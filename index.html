    <h1>Special Day</h1>
    <p contenteditable="true">
Have to write like this in a while so damn its really been almost 2 years right thats crazy to even think about ngl but its really been a long ass journey bro and its a relief knowing i got to meet u and spend all this time with u all these years and knowing ur still w me so i guess the least i can do is express my appreciation towards u n everything u did for me as much as i can because honestly i cant express it enough.

its been a pleasure meeting u nd not only but les go wayyyy back to 2023 cs thats crazy fr well u alredy know it but im still gon say it when i first met u in dh bro it was like crazy n its even more to think about if i didn't come up nd talk to u we would never meet so i keep being grateful every single day for everything cs things that happen by coincidence usually dont end up well but im glad ts was an exception. i have to say our friendship helped me sm not js mentally but also dealing with things i thought i couldn't go through like no way for example gray u know how shitty it was nd like u somehow still found a way to effortlessly calm me down n reassure me n i think thats what i like the most about our connection cs ever since we connected we could get eachother so easily we didn't even have to try personally i never had any issues when it came to communicating with u n idk but u also brought me peace its really hard to describe it with words but its just when we instantly clicked u made me actually feel peace like i had someone to go to knowing i wouldn't be judged but getting advice instead u just felt like home n i didn't have any experiences like ts with people i never felt about anyone like ts before so it was my first time too nd ur first everything is always unforgettable so it actually means sm to me. another thing i learned frm u was how to actually communicate n understand what was actually going on in situations like basically opening my eyes just learned i could even say psychological skills from u cs comparing myself 2 years ago to now is like 2 different people. hanging out n talking to u always made my mind clear nd helped me think straight which also made me more mature n more aware of whats happening nd another thing i rlly like bout our friendship is how we started emotionally helping eachother n then slowly building up humor n these lil jokes ykyk nd i think if it was the other way around we wouldn't be like we were now bru i cant explain it idk what to say the way u js talk just always seemed so logical n that way u never let me fall down u were always w me no matter what n thats so sweet like fr.
js know that i fr adore u more than anybody else nd ull always be known as my twin cs ur js so easy to talk to n ur so understanding ts like insane nd i hope it stays that way because the memories we made r insane like bru even from the rp ts is like experience right there n ts crazy how we survived so many fgs nd wtv we always had eachothers backs frfr bru i js love u sm ts not even bout ur personality ts js ur looks everything bout u is flawless don get me started on ur looks bro how do u always look so good u always got me blushin nd yeye ok we all got our insecurities but dam u different bro u js so pretty nd ur like my sister but also bsf get it n bf but ok we put that on the side. ok but deadass now u so gorgeous mommy nd i hope i somehow somewhat helped u thru situations too cs amy got us trippin but ye js know as long as we twins ill alwayshave ur back like i got u cs ur so goated nd i love u smok nd one thing thats also goated is how even tho we don talk everyday we still remain the same energy lkike we dont got that if we wont talk fo 2-3 days the energy gon fade away ts like siblings even better anyway i think u got the point so happy birthday unc i hope u enjoy ts day cs ts my twins special day tf n ye.

js thought a lil flashback was needed cs we have to write shi since new years i mean for me not u u dont have to but ye words cant describe how much i cherish every moment wu even if ts sum silly time goesso fast when im w u nd i can never express it enough so let it haunt u our memories r always gonna be unforgettable to me cs when im wu im genuinely happy nd u got me giggling so again happy bday baby nd i hope we continue making more memories cs if not im tellin ian nd u don wanna deal w him so ye happy bday buddy
